# Battery Alert Microsoft VBScript
Script from this website: https://www.thewindowsclub.com/create-laptop-battery-full-charge-notification

Edited for an Asus Laptop with the battery limit set to 80%.

As USB-C charging does not have power passthrough, charges the battery to the set limit and waits for it to drop below 79%, this script would remind myself to unplug the laptop to prevent excess battery cycles.
